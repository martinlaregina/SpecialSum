Test algorithm

## Getting Started

Develop an algorithm that satisfies the following function

```
k = 1, n = 3 -> 6
k = 2, n = 3 -> 10
k = 4, n = 10 -> 2002
k = 10, n = 10 -> 167960
k = 20, n = 20 -> 131282408400
k = 30, n = 30 -> 114449595062769120
k = 100, n = 100 -> Run the test to see the result in the screen
```

### Prerequisites

The parameters must be positive numbers

### Installing
